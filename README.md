            Thank you for reading the manual, too few people do that.

    1. Installation:
      Copy the contents of this archive into any directory with subfolders intact.

    2. Overview:
      The obective of the game is to get the Robot-Catgirl* (Mecha Neko-chan, you think we have a real name for her?) to the goalpost.
      You have no direct control of the girl and she isn't very intelligent. Letting her run on her own would mean certain death for her! Luckily you have an assortment of blocks and other level elements at your disposal to make the levels cat-safe.
      Use your bricks to make the girl reach the exit.

    3. UI:
      To control the game you need a two button mouse and a spacebar at minimum.
      During "run mode" there's a stop button in the top right corner of the screen, click it to kill Nekochan and return to edit mode.
      The left mouse button activates GUI buttons. Clicking left on elements placed by the player removes them from the level and puts them back into your inventory. Clicking left on the girl has the same effect as clicking on the go button.
      The right mouse button scrolls. Hold it and move the mouse to move your view around.
      The space bar selects an element from your inventory for placement. Press space to cycle through the available elements and click left to place them.
      Additional buttons include the enter key as a substitute for the go button or the girl, the escape key as a substitute for the close button of the window and the stop button (yes, we're intercepting clicks on "close", you got a problem with that?), the arrow keys to scroll and the H key to center the view on Mecha Neko-chan.

    4. Bricks of importance:
      Not all blocks are solid obstacles, some have special functions and others are even fatal when handled improperly:
      The red roadsign means "jump", Nekochan will jump when she comes across one of those. She won't jump if the base of the sign is below ground level.
      The green roadsign means "turn around". Fairly self-explainatory.
      The orange block with the green top is a Sebiblock (because it resembles randomZ), landing on one will make Nekochan jump again immediately (unless she lands too far on the side of the block).
      The steel block with the spikes on the bottom is called a Topblock, touching it from any direction except above kills Nekochan, landing on it makes her jump.
      The claw like object is always fatal.
      The cannon will shoot and kill Nekochan, touching the body of the weapon isn't any more healthy.

    5. Authors:
      For this piece of software are to blame:
      Sebastian "randomZ" Beschke, s.beschke@gmx.de, Coder, Sofu-Master, Neko-chan's voice pt.1, Musician, to blame for Mecha-Nekochan
      Marc "Maluck" Lucksch, marc_lucksch@web.de, Coder, Code Obscurer, Sofu-Killer, Level Designer (M02-04), Menu screen and name
      David "KDR_11k" Becker, KDR_11k@web.de, self-proclaimed Artist, Level Designer (level01-03, d_level0-2), Neko-chan's voice pt.2, Manual Writer

    * For the record: That was NOT my idea! Well, the "get lemming to exit" was, but not the catgirl. Blame randomZ for that. --KDR_11k
